move bookie/exchange definitions to an ahk file (create BettingSite class + list of these)
	- remove MBHotkey_xxx.txt files + python script

combine ShowOddsMonkeyGui_UM and ShowOddsMonkeyGui_CMCL
	- dropdown option for target (UM or CMCL)
	- or hide controls depending on target?
	
get OM row data BEFORE showing UI - pre-populate with OM row!

ditch drop-down for "Label" - assemble label from bookie + [label] + bettype (Q/F)

change calc multi to be Qualifier instead of Qualifier/Arb (so bet types are same on both excel sheets)

tick box for horses (append time if ticked)

if multiple accounts per bookie, drop-down defaults to empty (and fails if submitted empty) - stops recording against wrong account
